FairThreads library - version ft_v1.1 - september 2003

###############################################################
To compile the library:

1) edit the config file and set the place where fthread.h
and libfthread.a will be placed. The gcc, make, ar, and ranlib 
processors can be changed. 

2) go in the directory src and type make. The installation
will be done.
   
3) you can verify that the installation is correct by
running the tests in the directory tests, or the examples
in the directory examples.

###############################################################
Changes with previous ft_v1.0 version:

- The orders issued from ft_scheduler_stop, ft_scheduler_suspend,
and ft_scheduler_resume are processed in the order in which they
are issued (no more priority of suspend on resume, or the converse...).

- Schedulers have an access to the next thread to execute in
constant time (see files itemlist.h and itemlist.c).

- This version is used as target for the compilation of LOFT,
an experimental language which masks some difficulties of
FairThreads. It will be available very soon.
